;; MARK AND SWEEP
;;
;; A simple mark and sweep collector.  Easy to use these mechanisms to create
;; a generational approach where at some OID boundry, we store all pointers
;; from old to new space.

;; ISSUES:
;; - Mark non-class-indexed instances & persistent-collections by
;;   walking the root btree and class-indexed classes in the class-index btree
;; - Schema btree is ignored (for now)
;; - Sweep is over non-class-indexed classes in the class index

;; CONSEQUENCES:
;; - Only btrees not stored elsewhere are retained (e.g. pset in instance slot)
;; - Cursor read-committed in mvcc mode will ensure that class-index ops
;;   can proceed while marks are being put on the instance-table
